The problem was solved in two ways:

1)  Spring Batch

    run: mvn clean package && java -jar target/*jar -Dspring.profiles.active=batch file

    Initially it was thought that Spring Batch would be the best choice.
    But it's impossible to implement Producer-Consumer pattern with multiply consumers
        within springBatch.Step without ruining it's philosophy.

2)  Homemade

    run: mvn clean package && java -jar target/*jar file
